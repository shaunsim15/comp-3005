# What many people call views.py
# This is where you define the routes of your application. https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/organizing.html
# I propose we delete this, and instead create separate files like auth.py, similar to blog.py and auth.py https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/3.0.2/examples/tutorial/flaskr
# I note Schafer has uses folders with each having their own routes, also open to this. I think makes more sense if we wanna use Flask-WTF
